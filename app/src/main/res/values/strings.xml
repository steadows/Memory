    <string name="Starting_explain">The game will start after a 5 second countdown with an even number of cards organized into a grid of rows and columns. Each card will appear face down hiding the image on the other side. To reveal the image just tap on the card. You only tap 2 cards at a time. If the two images on the cards match then they will disappear and you will get a point for a completed match. If they do not match then they will flip back over hiding their images once again. The goal is to memorize the position and image of each card and then match it to its identical twin.</string>
